Pencil is an Android app, and it is simply the quickest way to offload
ideas, thoughts, and to-dos without losing focus. Pencil helps you in
reminding things by generating a persistent notification in your statusbar.
The reminder doesn't pop-up or rings, it just sits in your notification tray
and still does it's job most efficiently.
